### Hey there! 👋

I'm Jason, an undergraduate studying Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science.

⚡ I'm fascinated with commercial spaceflight, and how exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond can improve everyone's lives.

🔭 My main interests include rocket propulsion systems, reinforcement learning, and flight software design. 

🌱 Please feel free to reach out to me at my links.


Cheers! 🍻
